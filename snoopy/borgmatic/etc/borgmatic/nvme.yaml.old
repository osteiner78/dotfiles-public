# Constants to use in the configuration file. All occurrences of the
# constant name within curly braces will be replaced with the value.
# For example, if you have a constant named "hostname" with the value
# "myhostname", then the string "{hostname}" will be replaced with
# "myhostname" in the configuration file.
# constants:
    # hostname: myhostname
    # prefix: myprefix

# List of source directories and files to back up. Globs and tildes
# are expanded. Do not backslash spaces in path names.
source_directories:
    - /media/nvme
    # - /home/osteiner/
    # - /etc
    # - /var/log/syslog*
    # - /home/user/path with spaces

# A required list of local or remote repositories with paths and
# optional labels (which can be used with the --repository flag to
# select a repository). Tildes are expanded. Multiple repositories are
# backed up to in sequence. Borg placeholders can be used. See the
# output of "borg help placeholders" for details. See ssh_command for
# SSH options like identity file or port. If systemd service is used,
# then add local repository paths in the systemd service file to the
# ReadWritePaths list. Prior to borgmatic 1.7.10, repositories was a
# list of plain path strings.
repositories:
    # - path: ssh://user@backupserver/./sourcehostname.borg
    #   label: backupserver
  - path: /media/backups/borgbackup_snoopy
    label: local

# Name of the archive. Borg placeholders can be used. See the output
# of "borg help placeholders" for details. Defaults to
# "{hostname}-{now:%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f}". When running actions like
# rlist, info, or check, borgmatic automatically tries to match only
# archives created with this name format.
archive_name_format: '{hostname}-nvme-{now:%Y-%m-%d@%H:%M}'
