# Constants to use in the configuration file. All occurrences of the

# For example, if you have a constant named "hostname" with the value
# "myhostname", then the string "{hostname}" will be replaced with
# "myhostname" in the configuration file.

    # hostname: myhostname

# A required list of local or remote repositories with paths and
# optional labels (which can be used with the --repository flag to
# select a repository). Tildes are expanded. Multiple repositories are
# backed up to in sequence. Borg placeholders can be used. See the
# output of "borg help placeholders" for details. See ssh_command for
# SSH options like identity file or port. If systemd service is used,
# then add local repository paths in the systemd service file to the
# ReadWritePaths list. Prior to borgmatic 1.7.10, repositories was a
# list of plain path strings.

# Name of the archive. Borg placeholders can be used. See the output
# of "borg help placeholders" for details. Defaults to

# rlist, info, or check, borgmatic automatically tries to match only
# archives created with this name format.

# Any paths matching these patterns are included/excluded from

# contains leading punctuation, so it parses correctly. Note that only
# one of "patterns" and "source_directories" may be used.
