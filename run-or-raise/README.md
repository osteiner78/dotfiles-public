# Keyboard shortcuts for Linux

- keyd to remap keys on Apple keyboards (ie. <shift><control><alt><super> to <caps-lock>)
Cross-platform alternative for keyd (to consider?): [kmonad: An advanced keyboard manager](https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad)
Configuration file located in /etc/keyd/default.conf 

- [run-or-raise: GNOME3 extension](https://github.com/CZ-NIC/run-or-raise) to map keybindings to common apps
Configuration file located in .config/run-or-raise/shortcuts.conf
