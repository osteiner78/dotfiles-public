##### KEYD #################
# When you edit /etc/keyd/default.conf file:
# cd /etc/keyd
# cn # Open VSCode
# In another terminal:
# sudo journalctl -eu keyd -f
# ... this way you immediately see if there is some error,
# when you load new configuration (after saving the file):
# sudo keyd reload
# Finally when you are ready, in the /etc/keyd: add changes to git.

# Find keys with tool:
# sudo keyd monitor

# List keys that you can use with keyd:
# sudo keyd list-keys

# Modifiers:
# C - Control++
# M - Meta/Super++
# A - Alt++h
# S - Shift++
# G - AltGr
