[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1m-C, --config [22m<path>
           The  config file to use. By default, the following paths are checked: [4m$HOME/.swaylock/config[24m,
           [4m$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/swaylock/config[24m, and [4mSYSCONFDIR/swaylock/config[24m. All flags aside  from  this
           one  are  valid options in the configuration file using the format [4mlong-option=value[24m. For op‚Äê
           tions such as [4mignore-empty-password[24m, just supply the [4mlong-option[24m. All leading  dashes  should
           be omitted and the equals sign is required for flags that take an argument.

       [1m-d, --debug[0m
           Enable debugging output.

       [1m-e, --ignore-empty-password[0m
